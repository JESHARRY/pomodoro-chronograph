Pomodoro Chronograph

A Precision-Engineered Focus Timer

Pomodoro Chronograph is a luxury-inspired, production-grade Pomodoro timer designed to feel like a premium digital timepiece. Built entirely with HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the application emphasizes precision, visual realism, and calm productivity.

Unlike typical timer apps, this project focuses on synchronizing analog and digital time, robust state management, and a carefully balanced, immersive UI — similar to how a real chronograph watch behaves.
